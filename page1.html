    <p id="tex">Arkansas was probably the most fun summer trips I ever had. My cousins live super far away so we dont get  to see them so much. There is 6 people in their fmaily, My uncle Kevin, my aunt Amanda, and their 4 kids(Abbey, Mariah, Cali, and Lauren). The first day that we were there we went to this place that waslike a water hole but it was super fun. There was a rope swing over a big rock and I tried to do a backflip of itbut I failed and almost died.
Another time we were there we webt to a lake. The Lake had this huge floating pad on it the we wrestled on. The water was pretty clear and super warm. We kayacked all day and enjoyed our time. We celebrated my aunt and uncles birthdays. We stayed up past midnight everynight watching movies and playing games. It was the best time with my family ever.</p>
